# Programmer's Guide to Text Blocks

#### Jim Laskey and Stuart Marks\
Version 11 (August 2020)

[JEP 378](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378) introduces _text blocks_
into Java SE 15 as a Standard feature. While the JEP explains the feature
in great detail, it's not always apparent how the feature can and should
be used. This guide assembles practical usage advice for text blocks,
along with some style guidelines.

## Introduction

A text block's _principalis munus_ is to provide clarity by way of
minimizing the Java syntax required to render a string that spans
multiple lines.

In earlier releases of the JDK, embedding multi-line code snippets
required a tangled mess of explicit line terminators, string
concatenations, and delimiters. Text blocks eliminate most of these
obstructions, allowing you to embed code snippets and text sequences
more or less as-is.

A text block is an alternative form of Java string representation that can
be used anywhere a traditional double-quoted string literal can be used.
For example:

    // Using a literal string
    String dqName = "Pat Q. Smith";

    // Using a text block
    String tbName = """
                    Pat Q. Smith""";

The object produced from a text block is a `java.lang.String` with the
same characteristics as a traditional double-quoted string. This
includes object representation and interning. Continuing with `dqName`
and `tbName` from the examples above,

    // Both dqName and tbName are strings of equal value
    dqName.equals(tbName)    // true

    // Both dqName and tbName intern to the same string
    dqName == tbName         // true

Text blocks can be used anywhere a string literal can be used. For
example, text blocks may be intermixed with string literals in a
string concatenation expression:

    String str = "The old";
    String tb = """
                the new""";
    String together = str + " and " + tb + ".";

Text blocks may be used as a method argument:

    System.out.println("""
        This is the first line
        This is the second line
        This is the third line
        """);

String methods may be applied to a text block:

    """
    John Q. Smith""".substring(8).equals("Smith")    // true

A text block can be used in place of a string literal to improve the
readability and clarity of the code. This primarily occurs when a
string literal is used to represent a multi-line string. In this case
there is considerable clutter from quotation marks, newline escapes,
and concatenation operators:

    // ORIGINAL
    String message = "'The time has come,' the Walrus said,\n" +
                     "'To talk of many things:\n" +
                     "Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --\n" +
                     "Of cabbages -- and kings --\n" +
                     "And why the sea is boiling hot --\n" +
                     "And whether pigs have wings.'\n";

Using text blocks removes much of the clutter:

    // BETTER
    String message = """
        'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
        'To talk of many things:
        Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --
        Of cabbages -- and kings --
        And why the sea is boiling hot --
        And whether pigs have wings.'
        """;

## Using Text Blocks

#### Preview Feature in Java SE 13 and 14

Text blocks existed as a [Preview](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12)
feature of the Java Language in Java SE 13 and 14. In order to use text
blocks in those versions of Java SE, you must use the `--enable-preview`
and `-source` flags on the `javac` command line and the
`--enable-preview` flag on the `java` command line:

    javac --enable-preview -source 14 -d classes TextBlockExample.java
    java --enable-preview -cp classes com.example.TextBlockExample

Using Java SE 13 or 14 `jshell` to experiment with text blocks requires
using the `--enable-preview` flag as well:

    jshell --enable-preview

Use `--enable-preview` and `--source` flags (note: two hyphens) with the
Java SE 13 and 14 `java` command to compile and run a single source file
with a main program:

    java --enable-preview --source 14 TextBlockExample.java

(Single-file source code programs are described in
[JEP 330](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330).)

#### Standard Feature in Java SE 15 and Beyond

In Java SE 15 and beyond, the `--enable-preview` and `-source` flags are
no longer required to use text blocks:

    javac -d classes TextBlockExample.java
    java -cp classes com.example.TextBlockExample

To use `jshell` to experiment with text blocks simply requires using the
`jshell` command with no flags:

    jshell

The `java` command can be used to compile and run a single source file
with a main program, again with no additional flags:

    java TextBlockExample.java

(Single-file source code programs are described in
[JEP 330](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330).)


#### Text Block Syntax

A text block begins with three double-quote characters followed by a
line terminator. You can't put a text block on a single line, nor can
the contents of the text block follow the three opening double-quotes
without an intervening line terminator. The reason for this is that text
blocks are primarily designed to support multi-line strings, and
requiring the initial line terminator simplifies the indentation
handling rules (see the section below, _Incidental White Space_).

    // ERROR
    String name = """Pat Q. Smith""";

    // ERROR
    String name = """red
                     green
                     blue
                     """;

    // OK
    String name = """
        red
        green
        blue
        """;

This last example is equivalent to the following string literal:

    String name = "red\n" +
                  "green\n" +
                  "blue\n";

Here's an example of a snippet of Java code within a text block:

    String source = """
        String message = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println(message);
        """;

Note that there is no need to escape the embedded double quotes. The
equivalent string literal would be:

    String source = "String message = \"Hello, World!\";\n" +
                    "System.out.println(message);\n";

#### That Final New Line

Note that the example above,

    String name = """
        red
        green
        blue
        """;

is equivalent to `"red\ngreen\nblue\n"`. What if you want to represent a
multi-line string without that final `\n`?

    String name = """
        red
        green
        blue""";

This text block is equivalent to `"red\ngreen\nblue"`. Thus, placing
the closing delimiter on the last visible line effectively drops the
last `\n`. However, as described in guideline G12 below,
a better alternative is to use the `\<line-terminator>` escape sequence
(see [New Escape Sequences](#new-escape-sequences)).

#### Incidental White Space

Ideally, a text block would be indented to match the indentation of the
surrounding code. For example:

    void writeHTML() {
        String html = """
            <html>
                <body>
                    <p>Hello World.</p>
                </body>
            </html>
            """;
        writeOutput(html);
    }

However, this raises the question of how spaces used for indentation
affect the contents of the string. A naïve interpretation would include
all of this whitespace in the text block. The consequence would be that
reindenting the code would affect the contents of the text block. This
is quite likely to be an error.

To avoid this problem, a text block differentiates _incidental_ white
space from _essential_ white space. The Java compiler automatically
strips away the incidental white space. The indentation to the left of
`<html>` and `</html>` is considered incidental, since these lines are
indented the least. Thus, they effectively determine the left margin
of the text in the text block.  However, the indentation of `<body>`
relative to `<html>` is _not_ considered to be incidental white
space. Presumably, this relative indentation is intended to be part of
the string's contents.

The example below uses "`·`" to visualize the incidental white space,
with essential white space shown as actual white space.

    void writeHTML() {
        String html = """
    ········<html>
    ········    <body>
    ········        <p>Hello World.</p>
    ········    </body>
    ········</html>
    ········""";
        writeOutput(html);
    }

After the incidental white space is stripped, the resulting contents of
the text block are as follows:

    <html>
        <body>
            <p>Hello World.</p>
        </body>
    </html>

The algorithm for determining incidental white space is described in JEP
355 in scary detail. Nevertheless, the net effect is quite simple. The
entire contents of the text block is shifted to the left until the line
with the least leading white space has no leading white space.

To preserve some white space and not have it be considered incidental
white space, simply shift the content lines of the text block to the
right, while keeping the closing triple-quote delimiter at the
indentation appropriate for the surrounding code. For example:

    void writeHTML() {
        String html = """
    ········    <html>
    ········        <body>
    ········            <p>Hello World.</p>
    ········        </body>
    ········    </html>
    ········""";
        writeOutput(html);
    }

results in the following:

        <html>
            <body>
                <p>Hello World.</p>
            </body>
        </html>

A text block can _opt out_ of incidental white space
stripping by positioning the closing delimiter in the first character
position of a source line:

    void writeHTML() {
        String html = """
                      <html>
                          <body>
                              <p>Hello World.</p>
                          </body>
                      </html>
    """;
        writeOutput(html);
    }

The result is that there is no incidental white space that is
stripped, and the string includes leading white space on each line.

                      <html>
                          <body>
                              <p>Hello World.</p>
                          </body>
                      </html>

This technique for controlling the amount of indentation that is
preserved only works if the last line of the text block ends with a line
terminator. If the last line does _not_ end with a line terminator, you
need to use `String::indent` to control the indentation explicitly. In
the following example,

    String colors = """
        red
        green
        blue""";

all of the indentation is treated as incidental and is stripped away:

    red
    green
    blue

To include some indentation in the string's contents, invoke the
`indent` method on the text block:

    String colors = """
        red
        green
        blue""".indent(4);

This results in:

        red
        green
        blue

#### Trailing White Space

Trailing white space on each line in a text block is also considered
incidental and is stripped away by the Java compiler. This is done so
that the contents of the text block are always visually discernible.
If this were not done, a text editor that automatically strips
trailing white space could invisibly change the contents of a text
block.

If you need to have trailing white space in a text block, then you can
use one of the following strategies:

    // new escape sequence for space, see below
    String q = """
        trailing\s\s\s
        white space
        """;

    // character substitution
    String r = """
        trailing$$$
        white space
        """.replace('$', ' ');


    // character fence
    String s = """
        trailing   |
        white space|
        """.replace("|\n", "\n");


    // octal escape sequence for space
    String t = """
        trailing\040\040\040
        white space
        """;

**Note:** `\u0020` cannot be used because Unicode escapes are
translated early during source file reading, prior to lexical
analysis.  By contrast, character and string escapes such as `\040`
are processed after lexical analysis has divided the source file into
tokens and has identified string literals and text blocks.

#### Detecting Potential Issues with White Space

In the preceding examples, all indentation consisted of space
characters. However, sometimes people use TAB `\t` characters.
Unfortunately it is not possible for the Java compiler to know how tab
characters are displayed in different editors. Therefore, the rule is
that each individual white space character is treated equally. A
single space character is treated the same as a single tab character,
even though the latter might result in white space equivalent up to eight
spaces when displayed on some particular system.

It follows that mixing white space characters can have inconsistent and
unintended effects. Consider the following example, in which some lines
are indented with spaces and some with tabs (which are visualized with
`␉`):

        String colors = """
    ····················red
    ␉   ␉   ␉   ␉   ␉   green
    ····················blue""";

In this case, stripping of incidental indentation would be uneven since
the second line only has five white space characters and the others have
twenty. The result would look something like this:

                   red
    green
                   blue

It is possible to detect issues related to incidental white space by
turning on text block lint detection with a Java compiler lint flag,
`-Xlint:text-blocks`. If lint detection is on, then the above example
will generate a warning, "inconsistent white space indentation".

This lint flag also enables another warning, "trailing white space will
be removed", which will be emitted if there is trailing white space on
any line within a text block. If you need to preserve trailing white
space, use one of the escaping or replacement techniques described in
the section above.

#### Normalization Of Line Terminators

One of the complications of a multi-line string literal is that the line
terminator (`\n`, `\r`, or `\r\n`) used in the source file varies from
platform to platform. Editors on different platforms may invisibly
change line terminators. Or, if a source file is edited on different
platforms, a text block might contain a mixture of different line
terminators. This is likely to produce confusing and inconsistent
results.

To avoid these problems, the Java compiler normalizes all line terminators
in a text block to be `\n`, regardless of what line terminators actually
appear in the source file. The following text block (where `␊` and
`␍` represent `\n` and `\r`):

    String colors = """
        red␊
        green␍
        blue␍␊
        """;

is equivalent to this string literal:

    String colors = "red\ngreen\nblue\n";

If the platform line terminator is required then
`String::replaceAll("\n", System.lineSeparator())` can be used.

#### Translation Of Escape Sequences

As with string literals, text blocks recognize the escape sequences,
`\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\"`, `\'`, `\\`, and octal
escapes. Unlike string literals, escapes sequences are often not
required. Under most circumstances, the actual characters `\n`, `\t`,
`\"`, and `\'` can be used instead of escape sequences. The following
text block (where `␉` and `␊` represent  `\t` and `\n`):

    String s = """
        Color␉   Shape␊
        Red␉ ␉   Circle␊
        Green␉   Square␊
        Blue␉␉   Triangle␊
        """;

results in:

    Color␉  Shape␊
    Red␉ ␉  Circle␊
    Green␉  Square␊
    Blue␉␉  Triangle␊

Escaping is required when three or more double quotes occur
consecutively.

    String code = """
        String source = \"""
            String message = "Hello, World!";
            System.out.println(message);
            \""";
        """;

Escape translation occurs as the last step of processing by the Java
compiler, so you can bypass the line terminator normalization and
whitespace stripping steps by using explicit escape sequences. For example:

    String s = """
               red  \040
               green\040
               blue \040
               """;

would guarantee that all lines are of equal length since the `\040` does
not get translated to a space until after stripping of trailing white
space ("`·`" is used to show trailing space). The result is:

    red···
    green·
    blue··

**Note:** As noted previously, the Unicode escape sequence
`\u0020` _cannot_ be used as a substitute for `\040`.

#### New Escape Sequences

The `\<line-terminator>` escape sequence explicitly suppresses the inclusion of
an implicit new line character.

For example, it is common practice to split very long string literals into
concatenations of smaller substrings and then hard wrapping the resulting string
expression onto multiple lines.

      String literal = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing " +
                       "elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore " +
                       "et dolore magna aliqua.";

With the `\<line-terminator>` escape sequence this could be expressed as;

      String text = """
                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing \
                    elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore \
                    et dolore magna aliqua.\
                    """;

The `\s` escape sequence simply translates to space (`\040`, ASCII character 32,
white space). Since escape sequences don't get translated until after incidental
space stripping, `\s` can act as fence to prevent the stripping of trailing
white space. Using `\s` at the end of each line in the following example,
guarantees that each line is exactly six characters long.

    String colors = """
        red  \s
        green\s
        blue \s
        """;


## Style Guidelines For Text Blocks

**_G1. You should use a text block when it improves the clarity of the
code, particularly with multi-line strings._**

    // ORIGINAL
    String message = "'The time has come,' the Walrus said,\n" +
                     "'To talk of many things:\n" +
                     "Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --\n" +
                     "Of cabbages -- and kings --\n" +
                     "And why the sea is boiling hot --\n" +
                     "And whether pigs have wings.'\n";

    // BETTER
    String message = """
        'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
        'To talk of many things:
        Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax --
        Of cabbages -- and kings --
        And why the sea is boiling hot --
        And whether pigs have wings.'
        """;

**_G2. If a string fits on a single line, without concatenation and
escaped newlines, you should probably continue to use a string
literal._**

    // ORIGINAL - is a text block helpful here?
    String name = """
                  Pat Q. Smith""";

    // BETTER - a string literal works fine
    String name = "Pat Q. Smith";

**_G3. Use embedded escape sequences when they maintain readability._**

    var data = """
        Name | Address | City
        Bob Smith | 123 Anytown St\nApt 100 | Vancouver
        Jon Brown | 1000 Golden Place\nSuite 5 | Santa Ana
        """;

**_G4. For most multi-line strings, place the opening delimiter at the
right end of the previous line, and place the closing delimiter on its
own line, at the left margin of the text block._**

    String string = """
        red
        green
        blue
        """;

**_G5. Avoid aligning the opening and closing delimiters and the text
block's left margin. This requires reindentation of the text block if
the variable name or modifiers are changed._**

    // ORIGINAL
    String string = """
                    red
                    green
                    blue
                    """;

    // ORIGINAL - after variable declaration changes
    static String rgbNames = """
                             red
                             green
                             blue
                             """;

    // BETTER
    String string = """
        red
        green
        blue
        """;

    // BETTER - after variable declaration changes
    static String rgbNames = """
        red
        green
        blue
        """;

**_G6. Avoid in-line text blocks within complex expressions, as doing so
can distort readability. Consider refactoring to a local variable or to
a static final field._**

    // ORIGINAL
    String poem = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("jabberwocky.txt")));
    String middleVerses = Pattern.compile("\\n\\n")
                                 .splitAsStream(poem)
                                 .match(verse -> !"""
                                       ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

## New String Methods

Several new methods are included in the `String` class as part of the
text blocks feature. (Note that these methods are marked
deprecated, for removal, in Java SE 13 and 14, to indicate that they are part of a
preview feature.)

#### `String formatted(Object... args)`

This method is equivalent to `String.format(this, args)`. The
advantage is that, as an instance method, it can be chained off the
end of a text block:

    String output = """
        Name: %s
        Phone: %s
        Address: %s
        Salary: $%.2f
        """.formatted(name, phone, address, salary);

#### `String stripIndent()`

The `stripIndent` method removes incidental white space from a
multi-line string, using the same algorithm used by the Java
compiler. This is useful if you have a program that reads text as
input data and you want to strip indentation in the same manner as
is done for text blocks.

#### `String translateEscapes()`

The `translateEscapes` method performs the translation of escape
sequences (`\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\"`, `\'`, `\\`, `\s`,
`\<line-terminator>` and octal
escapes) and is used by the Java compiler to process text blocks and
string literals.  This is useful if you have a program that reads text
as input data and you want to perform escape sequence processing. Note
that Unicode escapes (`\uNNNN`) are _not_ processed.
